## App Update Feature

The app includes an automatic update checker that compares the current app version with the latest version stored in Firebase. If a newer version is available, the app will show a modal prompting the user to update.

### How it works

1. When the app starts, it checks the `app_version` collection in Firebase
2. It compares the current app version (from app.json) with the version in Firebase
3. If a newer version is available, it shows an update modal in the center of the screen
4. The modal displays the new version number and a changelog of what's new
5. When the user clicks "G√ºncelle" (Update), they are directed to the APK download URL
6. If the user clicks "Daha Sonra" (Later), the modal is dismissed

### What to expect

When an update is available, you'll see a modal dialog in the center of the screen with:
- A cloud download icon
- The title "Uygulama G√ºncellemesi" (App Update)
- The new version number
- A brief message about the update
- A changelog section showing what's new in this version
- Two buttons: "G√ºncelle" (Update) and "Daha Sonra" (Later)

### Firebase Collection Structure

The `app_version` collection should contain a document with ID `current` and the following fields:

```
{
  "apk_version": "1.3.5",
  "apk_url": "https://example.com/your-app.apk",
  "changelog": [
    "New feature added",
    "Bug fixes",
    "Performance improvements"
  ]
}
```

The `changelog` field should be an array of strings, each representing a change in the new version.

### Testing the Update Feature

To test the update feature, you can use the provided test script:

```
npm run test-updater
```

This script will:
1. Read your current app version from app.json
2. Check if there's already a version document in Firebase
3. Create or update the document with a version number higher than your current app version
4. Add a random set of changelog entries
5. Set a test APK URL

After running the script, restart your app to see the update modal with the changelog.

### Troubleshooting

If the update modal doesn't appear:
1. Make sure your app version in app.json is different from the version in Firebase
2. Check the Firebase console to verify the document exists in the app_version collection
3. Restart the app completely (not just a hot reload)
4. Check the console logs for any errors

### Customizing the Update Modal

The update modal is implemented in `components/AppUpdater.tsx`. You can customize the appearance and text by modifying this file.
